# Supervised_Machine_Learning_Regression
Regression models to predict gross income for a supermarket. 

In this project variants of the classic regression model are presented. Regularization techniques such as Ridge and Lasso were implemented in some models. GridSearcg was used to find optimal hypermarameters and a pipeline was implemented to combine the parameters and produce a robust model.
